			<p>Our group started weeks ago and wanted to simply find dogs who needed help and provide them the shelter, food, and love so that they can grow into the great dogs that we know they can be.</p>
			<p> Please browse and make your way to the "Adoptable Dogs" page to view all the kind, loving animals all of whom are up-to-date on shots.</p>
