    	<h3>Welcome to The Doghouse!</h3>
    	
        <hr>	
        
        <p>Thanks for visiting The Doghouse! Let us be your final stop on the road to finding your next 
        best friend. At The Doghouse, we specialize in matching you with the dog of your dreams. The Doghouse
        believes in finding true happiness between you and your best friend. </p>
        
        <h2>What We Stand For</h2>
        
        <p>Here at The Doghouse, we do not believe in breeding dogs for commercial sale, and instead, we foster 
        unwanted and forgotten dogs until we are able to successfully match them with their forever home. We are
        of the opinion that every dog deserves a home, but not every home deserves a dog.</p>
        
        <p></p>
        
        <h2>Meet our Best Friends!</h2>
        
    	<p>Our doors are always open to new dogs who are looking for their forever home. Although we cannot guarantee
    	that a particular pet will be available at the time of viewing them on our website, we encourage you to check
    	back regularly to our <a href='adopt.php' style="text-align:center;">Adopt</a> page as we are always welcoming
    	new dogs into our system. <p> 
    	
    	<p> If you are serious about adopting one of our loving animals into your home, we also
    	encourage you to fill out our patented 50 Dimensions of Compatibility survey in order to achieve a match that
    	is truely "meant to be".</p>
		
        <p></p>
        
        <h2>50 Dimensions of Compatibility</h2>	
        
        <p>On the road of life, everybody needs a friend. At The Doghouse, we take the phrase "man's best friend" to
        heart. The Doghouse was founded on the belief that all dogs deserve a loving forever home. We have developed a
        patented formula for matching you with your ideal dog friend based on 50 dimensions of best-friend compatibility.
        The Doghouse matches potential owners and dog friends based on a deeper level of compatibility, not likes and
        annoyances, but true compatibility. Are you and your potential dog friend lovers of long walks on the beach or
        fun-filled moutain hikes? Perhaps you and your friend would prefer nice relaxing weekends hanging out on the 
        couch watching a good movie and simply enjoying some pets? </p>
        
        <p> We are full believers of total happiness for both 
        parties, that of the owner and the dog. We stand by our formula and dog-matching process 100%, and we require 
        semi-annual progress reports from one of our verified veterianarian's on the dog's health and wellbeing. We 
        care deeply about each and every animal that passes through our system, and want to make sure they, and their 
        owner, are as happy and healthy as possible. </p>
        
        <p></p>
        
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        
        <p>Up until the first year has passed with acceptable reports from both dog and owner, The Doghouse remains 
        able to re-home the dog if we see fit. Although we are confident in our patented 50 Dimensions of Compatibility
        formula, there remains a great deal of responsibility and uncertainty with regards to the abilities of the 
        caretaker to provide adequitely for their new best friend. </p>
